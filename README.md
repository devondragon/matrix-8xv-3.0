# Matrix Labs 8xv3.0 Keyboard Help
Guides and tools for the Matrix Labs 8XV 3.0 Keyboard (not affiliated with Matrix Labs)

The Matrix 3.0 is an amazing keyboard, however when I first got one, I had some trouble figuring out how to update the firmware and map keys.  I also had issues with getting animated gifs to work on the eye screen.  Much of the documentation I found was unclear or out of date.  However, with the help of some great folks in the Matrix Labs Discord channel, I was able to get everything working.  

I wanted to make things easier on folks like me and make a simple guide, with links and tools, to update the firmware and map keys, as well as add your own animated gifs to the eye screen.

**Caveat:** This is what worked for me, on a Mac, with my keyboard.  I can't promise it will work for you.  If you get stuck, the Matrix Labs Discord is a good place to go for help.
